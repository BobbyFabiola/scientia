# Introduction

Programming I is the first course of a two-course sequence designed to learn programming as a means to solve computing problems.

This course begins with an introduction to fundamental understanding of algorithms, its modes of expression and applicability to procedural problems.

_Variables_, _data types_, _operators_, _program control structures_, _functions_, _pointers_, _storage classes_, _arrays_ and _recursion_ are introduced with an emphasis in training the students to design, and implement programs by hand and then in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
