Inspired by one of the virtues taught by the university, **Scientia** is the culmination of a dedicated effort to bridge the knowledge gaps in programming and computer science within the DCISM student body.

Created by the USC Computer and Information Sciences Council, **Scientia** serves as a centralized community-driven platform where students can share & access reliable resources and tutorials on various programming subjects.

## Features of Scientia

Scientia offers a variety of features aimed at helping students master complex programming concepts. These include:

- **Notes**: In-depth guides on various programming languages and tools.
- **Practice Exercises**: Hands-on exercises and coding challenges to reinforce learning.
- **Community Contributions**: This project is hosted on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/usc-cisco/scientia) and is open for contributions.

## Open Source and Community Involvement

One of the core philosophies behind Scientia is its open-source nature.

The platform is designed to be a collaborative project where anyone, from students to industry professionals, can contribute.

This open-source approach not only ensures that the content remains up-to-date and relevant but also fosters a community of learners and educators working together to improve the platform.
